# NewsApp
 I coded this News App in JavaScript using Pusher API and News API. I also used ReactIDE for the client side code and Node.js for the server side. I ran a server that collected specified information from Pusher's server and kept pushing it to the client, so the page automatically shows new updatees without needing to refresh. You will need to run Server.js, App.js, App.css, and start both servers (on a Mac, you can use terminal and enter in the command yarn start) for the news to run. You will need to additionally have variables.env open and you will need to enter this url into your browser: http://localhost:3000/ for the news to stream to that tab. You can change the topic of the news in the App.js in line 14 where instead of California Wildfires, you can enter whatever topic you would like news on. I had a lot of fun programming this news streaming app!
